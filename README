This folder contains the following:
1. Matrix of 2000 US Census county-to-county commuter data
2. Matrix of county-to-county movement probability made using the radiation model
3. Sorted list of FIPS codes for the counties in the matrices
4. A sample of python code to load and manipulate the matrices

Each matrix is a 3109x3109 normal python list (not numpy).
Rows represent the source county, columns the destination county.
Values along the diagonal of both matrices are 0.
Rows in the probability matrix sum to 1.
